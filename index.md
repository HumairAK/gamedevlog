## Welcome to my Game Dev Blog

This is mostly to serve as a way for me to document some procedures/tasks that I am prone to forget, and can refer back to at a later date. 

I am a huge beginner to Blender/Unity, so I don't claim to know everything, nor do I claim that these are best practices. In fact if anyone has a better way to do something, please reach out to me and let me know!
